Synchronize your photos and metadata between Lightroom and WordPress.

== Description ==

Synchronize your photos and metadata between Lightroom and WordPress. This plugin is made to work like a charm with the WP/LR Sync plugin for Lightroom (http://apps.meow.fr/wplr-sync).

Lightroom will be then able to add, update and delete photos directly. Titles, captions and alternative texts can be also synchronized. 

If you dream to link the photos you uploaded previously with the original ones in Lightroom, this is possible. Using EXIF and image perceptual analysis, the plugin will offer you to link them. You also have the choice to do it manually through WordPress. The user interface will guide you through it.

Languages: English.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-lrsync` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. In 'Media', there is a new WP/LR Sync section. Check it out :)
